# Challenge SRE Cloud

This repo contains all files needed to deploy my version of the challenge.

All the infrastructure is deployed to AWS using Terraform. There are also an ansible script which configures the EC2 instance, build and deploy the golang application to a docker container.

To get instructions about how to deploy the code or what resources will be created on your AWS account, please read this file.
